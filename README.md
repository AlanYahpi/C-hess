# C-hess
A chess game that aspires to be a chess engine.
A project to challenge my reasoning and programming skills, since I targeted not to watch any tutorial, web, or asking AI about how a chess game is programmed.
## Schedule
- Windows executable: never, no necessity
- Add all special moves
- Add notation
